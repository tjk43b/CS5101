#Homework 2
#Overview
#Objectives
#Utilize Test Driven Development to develop a rudimentary, yet high quality calculator
#Utilize the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to build an architecture that separates user interaction from business logic

#
#Grading Notes
#This assignment is worth 100 points.
#We will be looking for the following characteristics in your submission:
#
#Use of MVC design pattern
#“View” code should be purely focused on communication with the user – no business logic
#Calculator model should do all the math
#Controller should manage communication between model and view
#Controller knows exactly what view and model it has
#Model does not know about view or controller, but it is allowed to generate events that the controller will handle
#View does not know about model or controller, but it is allowed to generate events that the controller will handle
#
#Use of TDD
#History of commits in git should demonstrate that model code is always committed with unit tests – evidence of proper TDD technique 
#As a rule of thumb, you should be able to remove a single line of code from the model and produce a unit test failure
#
#Functionality
#Add two integers
#Subtract two integers
#Multiply two integers
#Divide two integers
#
#Kanban usage
#You should have one card on the Kanban board for the four required operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
#Git commit history should reflect which card on your Kanban board was being worked
#
#Work as Pairs
#This homework assignment is meant to be done by two people working as a pair.  This means two people sitting at the same computer, preferably with two keyboards and two mice connected to the same computer.
#
#Software Toolset
#For this assignment, you may use the following language IDE combinations:
#Swift / xCode
#C++ / Visual Studio, C Lion
#C# / Visual Studio
#Java / Eclipse, IntelliJ
#Python / pyCharm
#Use of the Kanban board is required
#Use of git is required
#
#Description
#Develop a rudimentary calculator that provides the ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two integers.  The user interface can be graphical or command line, as you choose.  Ensure that your interface is clear and concise.
